## Note
- **VPN Requirement**: If you're accessing this project from outside NYCU (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), you'll need to connect to the NYCU VPN to load the `iris.csv` data. This dataset likely contains sensitive information or is restricted to NYCU's network.
- **Number of bins**: The approximate number of bins is installed by d3 automatically. Please follow this address `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43380637/javascript-d3-histogram-thresholds-producing-wrong-number-of-bins`.

## Features
This project offers the following features:

1. **Species Hover**: Hover over each species (e.g., setosa, versicolor, virginica) to view all data points associated with that species.
2. **Brush Selection**: Use the brush tool to select a subset of data points. This feature allows you to focus on specific portions of the dataset.
3. **Data Point Totalization**: The project provides a summary of the total number of data points that have been selected using the brush tool.

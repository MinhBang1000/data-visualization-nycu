# Visualizing World University Rankings 2024: A Stacked Bar Chart Approach - Homework 5

## Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `313540015.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- `313540015.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for data visualization and interaction.
- `313540015.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `data.csv`: The data file used for visualization.

## Run
To run the application, open the `313540015.html` file using Live Server or a local server. This will allow you to view the application in your web browser without encountering CORS issues.

### Instructions
1. **Live Server**: If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Live Server extension. Right-click on `313540015.html` and select "Open with Live Server."
2. **Local Server**: Alternatively, you can set up a local server using Python or Node.js:
   - **Python**: Run the following command in the terminal within your project directory:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - **Node.js**: Install `http-server` globally and run:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```

After starting the server, access your application at `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate address for your server setup).
